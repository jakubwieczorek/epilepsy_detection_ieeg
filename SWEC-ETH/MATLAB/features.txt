1) high pick (needle) in intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG)
2) during seizure, iEEG can get back to very small value (P specifically) and after around 15s it gets back to really high value.

Pattern in patient 2; 230h, 233h:
a) very high pick in the middle of a seizure especially in a power signal around 1e6pW, in a signal 5/10 times higher then average, so 1000uV
b) from envelope seizure can be faster detected, in power first half of a seizure is almost like a normal signal
c) during seizure, iEEG can get back to very small value (P specifically) and after around 15s it gets back to really high value.
d) seizure lasts for 80s
e) 1,5 min after seizure iEEG is higher than usually around 2 times for 2/3 minutes

Pattern in patient 2, 1h
a) signal does not exceed 100uV, power 500pW
b) no picks, like a noise
